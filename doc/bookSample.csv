With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates."Data Science: Questions and Answers,George Duckett ,Data Science;,http://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Questions-George-Duckett-ebook/dp/B01D81076E/ref=sr_1_49?ie=UTF8&qid=1461360077&sr=8-49&keywords=data+science,"Machine Learning, Bigdata, Data Mining, Classification, Neuralnetwork, Statistics, Python, Clustering, R, Text Mining, NLP, Dataset, Efficiency, Algorithms, Hadoop, SVM, Tools, Recommendation, Visualization, Databases, Feature Selection, NoSQL, K Means, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and many more."Analytics in a Big Data World: The Essential Guide to Data Science and its Applications,Bart Baesens, big data & analytics;,http://www.amazon.com/Analytics-Big-Data-World-Applications/dp/1118892704?ie=UTF8&isInIframe=1&n=283155&redirect=true&ref_=dp_proddesc_0&s=books,"The guide to targeting and leveraging business opportunities using big data & analyticsBy leveraging big data & analytics, businesses create the potential to better understand, manage, and strategically exploiting the complex dynamics of customer behavior.

The first part explores the fundamental tools of data science. It includes basic graph theoretical methods, statistical and AI methods for massive data sets. In second part, chapters focus on the procedural treatment of data science problems including machine learning methods, mathematical image and video processing, topological data analysis, and statistical methods. The final section provides case studies on special topics in variational learning, manifold learning, business and financial data recovery, geometric search, and computing models.

Next, Part III focuses on process discovery as the most important process mining task, while Part IV moves beyond discovering the control flow of processes, highlighting conformance checking, and organizational and time perspectives. Part V offers a guide to successfully applying process mining in practice, including an introduction to the widely used open-source tool ProM and several commercial products. Lastly, Part VI takes a step back, reflecting on the material presented and the key open challenges."Data Science with Java,Michael R. Brzustowicz ,DATA SCIENCE; JAVA;,,
