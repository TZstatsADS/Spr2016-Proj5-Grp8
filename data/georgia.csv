DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS: The VOW Act
Chapter 21 of Title 5, United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 2108a, requires
Federal agencies treat active duty service member as veterans, disabled
veterans, and preference eligible, when they submit, at the time they apply for
a Federal job, a ""certification"" of active service in lieu of a DD214, assuming
the service member is otherwise eligible. A ""certification"" letter should be on letterhead of the appropriate
military branch of the service and contain (1) the military service dates
including the expected discharge or release date; and (2) the character of
service. The service member's military
service dates are necessary in order to determine whether he or she meets the
definition of ""veteran"" under 5 U.S.C. 2108(1). The ""certification"" must reflect
the service member is expected to be discharged or released from active duty
service in the armed forces under honorable conditions not later than 120 days
after the date of submission. The
""certification"" must be signed by, or by direction of, the adjutant, personnel
officer, or commander of your unit or higher headquarters and must indicate
when your terminal leave will begin (if applicable), your rank, dates of active
duty service, the type of discharge and character of service (i.e.
honorable). Further, under paragraph (h)
of the rule, agencies are required to verify a qualifying separation from
military service prior to appointment, through the DD214 or other appropriate
documentation. Your preference and/or
appointment eligibility will be verified prior to appointment. Active duty members that fail to provide a
valid ""certification"" of service with their initial application will be found
""not eligible"". Military members may be
appointed before the effective date of their military retirement/separation if
member is on terminal leave. WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT: Once your application package is received an acknowledgement email will be sent. If you provided an email address, you will receive an email message acknowledging receipt of your application. Your application package will be used to determine your eligibility and qualifications for consideration.

adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by one of the following: 1. Professional registration -- Current registration as a professional engineer by any State, the District
of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Absent other means of qualifying under this standard,
those applicants who achieved such registration by means other than written
test (e.g., State grandfather or eminence provisions) are eligible only for
positions that are within or closely related to the specialty field of their
registration. For example, an applicant who attains registration through a
State Board's eminence provision as a manufacturing engineer typically would be
rated eligible only for manufacturing engineering positions. 2. Written Test -- Evidence of

(a) a bachelor's degree in engineering technology (BET) from an accredited
college or university that included 60 semester hours of courses in the
physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences, or (b) a BET from a program
accredited by the Accreditation Board for
Engineering and Technology (ABET) may be rated eligible for certain engineering
positions at GS-5. Eligibility is limited to positions that are within or closely
related to the specialty field of the engineering technology program.
Applicants for positions that involve highly technical research, development,
or similar functions requiring an advanced level of competence in basic science
must meet the basic requirements in paragraph A. Because of the diversity
in kind and quality of BET programs, graduates of other BET programs are
required to complete at least 1 year of additional education or highly
technical work experience of such nature as to provide reasonable assurance of
the possession of the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for
professional engineering competence. The adequacy of this background must be
demonstrated by passing the EIT examination. 3. Specified academic courses --
Successful completion of at least 60 semester hours of courses in the physical,
mathematical, and engineering sciences and in engineering that included the
courses specified in the basic requirements. The courses must be fully
acceptable toward meeting the requirements of a professional engineering
curriculum as described in paragraph A. 4. Related curriculum --
Successful completion of a curriculum leading to a bachelor's degree in
engineering technology or in an appropriate professional field, e.g., physics,
chemistry, architecture, computer science, mathematics, hydrology, or geology,
may be accepted in lieu of a degree in engineering, provided the applicant has
had at least 1 year of professional engineering experience acquired under
professional engineering supervision and guidance. Ordinarily there should be
either an established plan of intensive training to develop professional
engineering competence, or several years of prior professional engineering-type
experience, e.g., in interdisciplinary positions. (The above examples of
related curricula are not all-inclusive.) AND SPECIALIZED
EXPERIENCE FOR GS-07: In order to qualify for this position, your resume must demonstrate at least
