Morgan Corporate & Investment Bank J.P. Morgan’s Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) is a global leader in Banking. The world’s corporations, governments and institutions entrust us with their business in more than 100 countries. The Corporate & Investment Bank supports our clients around the world providing strategic advice, raising capital and managing risk. Who we are We are a small, focused team of passionate engineers, data and business people and designers set on creating and building products that transform the way we and our clients do business. Sure, we are part of a large financial services firm operating in a highly-regulated environment, and that means we are not as flexible or agile as your average company – let alone a startup. But we are careful stewards of our clients’ trust and money and combine creativity and speed with discipline and awareness. It also means that what we build matters and have huge impact; our products and solutions will reach our 1000s of clients around the world, and affect how J.P. Morgan does business – from trading securities in multiple markets to moving trillions of dollars a day. We won’t build it unless we know it is scalable. We are obsessed with effectiveness, productivity and efficiency; if we find an issue or broken process, we fix it. We work with the right tools, make decisions quickly, and only pursue those ideas that can scale and meet our clients’ and our business’ critical needs. Why join? This is a fascinating time in our industry. By now, it’s a cliché that Banks will have to embrace technology and innovation if they are to thrive in the years to come. We are already bought into this and are committed to show that we can do it, and are looking for others to join. You will: - Work on some of the most complex problems imaginable at the intersection of two dynamic industries – finance and technology. - Interact with insanely large and fascinating data currently not available anywhere else. - Develop products that can change the way 1000s of clients operate, and how Banking is done today.

However, please know that U.S. federal law requires all U.S.-based employees to provide proof to their employer of their eligibility to work in the U.S. Director of Strategic Communications Summary The SSRC seeks a Director of Strategic Communications to lead its Communications Department and work closely with senior management and program leadership to design and implement communications strategies across various platforms. Description The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) is an independent, international, nonprofit organization devoted to the advancement of interdisciplinary research in the social sciences through a wide variety of workshops and conferences, fellowships and grants, summer training institutes, scholarly exchanges, research, and publications. The SSRC invites applications for the position of Director of Strategic Communications (DSC). The Director of Strategic Communications is a new and senior position at the Social Science Research Council. The SSRC is devoted to improving the quality and impact of social science research, and the DSC will play a central role in designing and implementing communication strategies that increase the visibility and impact of the SSRC, the work of its programs, and the social sciences more generally. Qualifications The successful candidate will need to have two broad sets of attributes—one related to the SSRC’s external audiences, the other related to its internal operations and culture. Internally, the DSC will work closely with the Council’s senior management team, the leadership of its various programs, and its Development team while mobilizing the Communications staff. The DSC will work especially closely with the director of the Digital Culture program in supporting the communication strategies and skills of the various Council programs, helping them imagine innovative digital communication projects and other publications that support their goals. The DSC will also work closely with the Director of Technology in developing appropriate communication technologies for the Council, improving systems for collecting and analyzing data on the audiences reached by the SSRC via its various communication channels, and unifying the Council’s digital publishing platforms. Given the importance of these diverse working relationships, the DSC must be a proven bridge builder with excellent collegial, consultative, and listening skills that enhance programs’ abilities to reach intended audiences and imagine new ones. Externally, the DSC should be deeply engaged in and experienced with enhancing the visibility of research in public arenas. This includes existing networks in the media and with relevant institutions in academic and policy communities, and the interest and capacity to develop new ones. Strong communication skills, including experience in translating the results of research and scholarship to broader audiences, are essential, as is an ability to contribute to developing institutional narratives that convey a consistent and coherent message about the work of the Council, not least for fundraising purposes. Responsibilities Important components of this role include providing strategic guidance on institutional messaging and digital content (including the SSRC’s website), supporting Council staff and program participants in designing communication strategies aligned with programmatic goals and the Council’s mission, and developing public relations and media strategies. The DSC will work closely with the SSRC’s senior management team in identifying priorities for the Council’s communication resources, including personnel and technology, and make recommendations for the most effective use of these resources. The DSC will lead the Communications unit, which includes expertise in information technology, web development, design, social media, editing, and publishing. Terms, Salary and Benefits Annual salary will be commensurate with experience. Comprehensive benefits include health, dental, vision, disability, life, and gym reimbursement; outstanding pension plan and tax savings programs; generous vacation and sick leave; and more. Provisions are made for professional staff to continue their development as social scientists while at the Council. Application Information To apply, please send a cover letter, resume, writing sample, and the names of at least three professional colleagues who can serve as references to applications@ssrc.org . Please put “Director of Strategic Communications Search” in the subject line. Applications will be accepted until the position has been filled but should be received by May 1, 2016, for priority consideration.

He thinks that talent is a common quality in the field of IT, but the people at Reaktor are set apart by a very specific one: kindness. Timo is a graphic designer who reckons that the people best suited to become his colleagues really love what they do and want to get better at it. On the other hand, he also feels that the biggest challenge at Reaktor is to constantly stay on top your game. Ellu is a make-it-happenizer, user interface design student and hobbymaniac. She thinks the coolest thing about of her job is turning technological solutions into services for humans. How does one get hired? Mikael has some tips. Think of the interview as a conversation, not an interrogation Read the tips You’re hired! In other words: how to get a job at Reaktor There seems to be a prevailing belief that it’s difficult to get a job at Reaktor. Well, ok, the recruitment process is without a doubt intense, and yes, we only want to hire the people with most potential. However, the pitfall often seems to be that many qualified applicants just don’t know how to promote themselves in the best possible way or include the right content in their CV. We honestly want to attract as many candidates as possible who are a perfect fit for us. So, I thought I’d put together some tips to help you get a grasp of what we’re looking for. Especially seeing that some of the career guides online aren’t that spot-on from our perspective. Think of the interview as a conversation, not an interrogation. The whole point is to talk to each other and get to know one another. Mutually. It’s perfectly OK to be a bit nervous. Most of us are. Rest assured: the people on the other side of the table have seen nervous before, so they can see your true colours through it. Keep your CV nice and compact (rule-of-thumb: less than two pages). The same goes for your cover letter (a one-pager). Include a brief description of each of your previous jobs in your CV. Tell us about the cool things you’ve been up to, and what your heart desires in the future. Avoid major overlapping and repetition between your CV and cover letter. Also avoid cluttering your application with too much glitter and candy. We want it elegant and clear-cut. Remember: never send your application in an open format like doc/x, but rather as a pdf, for example. Be yourself. Don’t put up an act. Pretending to be someone you’re not probably won’t get you through the first interview, let alone the first few weeks in your new job. Show up wearing comfortable clothes, something that you usually like to wear. Don’t dress up as someone else. We want to meet the real you, the person we’re thinking of hiring. Tell us about who you are and what you’re into. We’re honestly interested in getting to know you, because we want you to be a part of our company and its culture. Don’t worry too much about whether you’re good enough or not. We promise we’ll figure it out together. Many of the current Reaktorians didn’t know whether they’d cut the mustard either – and it just so happened they got hired. There’s nothing to lose. Make sure you show what you know. We really value hard-core know-how, and of course the newest technology trends get our attention. In advance, figure out what it is you’re really good at, and let us know it too. On the other hand, be open about the things you still need to improve in. All of us have something we’re not that big on. Got people skills? Perfect. Yes, it’s important to be a top-notch professional, but social skills shouldn’t be undervalued either. At Reaktor, it’s a big plus that you work well with others. Sometimes a social talent even outweighs a professional talent. Reflect on what kind of communities and work cultures you’ve been a part of, and what kinds of set-ups ring true to you. Don’t pigeonhole yourself. So, you’re a java wizard from 9 to 5, but when you get home you like to spend time taking photographs? That’s great! Everything counts, even the things you potter around with when you’re off duty. You just might be the multi-talent we’re looking for. Don’t let fear or nervousness stop you. You can keep brushing up on your skills forever, but you know what? You can also keep developing while already in the job. We don’t need you to be perfect – we need you to have a burning desire to learn. The potential in you is the juiciest bit. Yes, the recruitment process might feel a tad suspenseful, but we promise you’ll only be dealing with humans (much like yourself!). No monsters involved. And if it’s a no-go this time, you can always apply again later. In the end, a job interview is always a very educating experience. Why not apply right now? Best of luck, see you soon! What we believe in Structures, contexts and businesses change as the may, but our spiritual foundations stay the same. These five entities are the cornerstones of our biggest asset: our culture. Getting shit done We focus on results. That means that we keep the ball rolling and are genuinely passionate about taking our clients’ businesses to the next – no, third – level.	Concrete and tangible beats well-planned every time, because a working prototype is worth a hundred meetings. That is also why the client is always an essential part of the team. Freedom and responsibility Our teams direct themselves. That way, they have the power to make quick decisions and can react to changes fast. With great freedom comes great responsibility: we trust that our people know how to make good use of their time and the clients’ money. All reaktorians are devoted to both making projects succeed and keeping our business profitable. Kaizen We set our sights to year 2200. All our decisions are based on sustainable grounds – we are in this for the long run. Curiosity, experimentalism and iterations are in our DNA. We view our own work critically and are constantly willing to improve – both as individuals and as a company. Failures are regarded as opportunities to learn. Boss-level community Our company is a flexible network of top notch professionals. The best want to work with the best, and we encourage each other to succeed on a daily basis. Basically, we’re a community of people who want to make the most out of their skills by constantly learning new things. We work in multifunctional teams of technology, design and business experts. Djuizzz We don’t take ourselves too seriously – our work speaks for itself. We like to pull positive stunts to surprise our colleagues, clients and the whole industry: take HWO or Kids’ Code School, for example. Djuizzz is the character that make us special, bold and just a tiny bit twisted. We behave in a way that reflects our driven attitude and healthy self-esteem. Children’s Coding School Sometimes the best ideas come accidentally – like with the Children’s Coding School. It all started when Juha started teaching his 4-year-old daughter the basics of computing. To keep track of the lessons, he founded a blog called Girls Can’t Code which got surprisingly popular. The word about the lessons spread among Reaktorians and soon Juha was asked to teach also his colleagues’ children. All sessions were packed with enthusiastic kids. Juha wondered if other kids would want to learn the essence of coding too. He organized the first public session in January 2014 and it got fully booked in a few minutes. At that point he realized no one could match the demand alone and started asking for help from other IT companies. Luckily, they were happy to participate. Since 2014 there has been dozens of sessions which have involved several IT companies, public libraries and hundreds of enthusiastic children.

relationship manager to develop and implement the organization’s
United States fundraising program with a focus on generating
unrestricted income from major gifts. As the first staff member
based in the United States, the Associate Director, Major Gifts
will serve as a key ambassador for ClientEarth’s mission, building
and managing a new donor and volunteer base in support of the
organization’s international work. About ClientEarth ClientEarth is an organization of activist lawyers committed to
securing a healthy planet by working to ensure that good
environmental laws are enforced and that poor ones are challenged.
The organization’s legal approach to environmental problems is
unique in Europe; until ClientEarth was established in 2006 there
was not one environmental NGO practicing law for the public
interest on a pan-European scale. Over the past nine years,
ClientEarth has grown significantly to become a £6.7 million (~$9.5
million) annual operation, employing over 100 lawyers, policy
experts, and scientists to create pragmatic solutions to key
environmental challenges across Europe as well as in Asia and
Africa. This year, the organization is expanding its work into
China, opening an office in New York and rolling out a wave of
clean air cases across Europe. ClientEarth’s continued growth will
help protect the environment on ever-expanding fronts. About Philanthropy at ClientEarth For nearly a decade, philanthropy has played a critical role in
driving the growth of ClientEarth’s operation by approximately 25%
per annum and scaling its impact around the globe. Historically,
the organization has been supported almost entirely by
institutional funders – governments, foundations and trusts. Over
the past couple years, ClientEarth has begun to develop an
individual giving platform, connecting a broader audience of
ambassadors and advocates with its work. In early 2015, ClientEarth
hired a Major Gifts Manager to work with the Director of
Development to drive the development and execution of a major gift
strategy. The Associate Director, Major Gifts in New York will
expand this major gift strategy by building and activating a base
of support in the United States to support ClientEarth’s global
work. These efforts have been and will continue to be driven by the
organization’s leadership, including the Board of Trustees
(ClientEarth’s global governing Board), the Development Board (a
sub-committee of the global Board) and the newly formed U.S. Board

Advanced J Job Associate Director, Major Gifts Job Job posted by: Development Guild/DDI Posted on: April 7, 2016 Share Bookmark Print More / Less Job description ClientEarth seeks a self-motivated and skilled strategist and relationship manager to develop and implement the organization's United States fundraising program with a focus on generating unrestricted income from major gifts. As the first staff member based in the United States, the Associate Director, Major Gifts will serve as a key ambassador for ClientEarth's mission, building and managing a new donor and volunteer base in support of the organization's international work. About ClientEarth ClientEarth is an organization of activist lawyers committed to securing a healthy planet by working to ensure that good environmental laws are enforced and that poor ones are challenged. The organization's legal approach to environmental problems is unique in Europe; until ClientEarth was established in 2006 there was not one environmental NGO practicing law for the public interest on a pan-European scale. Over the past nine years, ClientEarth has grown significantly to become a £6.7 million ($9.5 million) annual operation, employing over 100 lawyers, policy experts, and scientists to create pragmatic solutions to key environmental challenges across Europe as well as in Asia and Africa. This year, the organization is expanding its work into China, opening an office in New York and rolling out a wave of clean air cases across Europe. ClientEarth's continued growth will help protect the environment on ever-expanding fronts. About Philanthropy at ClientEarth For nearly a decade, philanthropy has played a critical role in driving the growth of ClientEarth's operation by approximately 25% per annum and scaling its impact around the globe. Historically, the organization has been supported almost entirely by institutional funders – governments, foundations and trusts. Over the past couple years, ClientEarth has begun to develop an individual giving platform, connecting a broader audience of ambassadors and advocates with its work. In early 2015, ClientEarth hired a Major Gifts Manager to work with the Director of Development to drive the development and execution of a major gift strategy. The Associate Director, Major Gifts in New York will expand this major gift strategy by building and activating a base of support in the United States to support ClientEarth's global work. These efforts have been and will continue to be driven by the organization's leadership, including the Board of Trustees (ClientEarth's global governing Board), the Development Board (a sub-committee of the global Board) and the newly formed U.S. Board of Trustees. About the Position The Associate Director, Major Gifts will join a passionate and entrepreneurial team as ClientEarth's first United States team member. Reporting to the Director of Development, s/he will be charged with designing and implementing a major donor fundraising program in the U.S. Key among his/her responsibilities, the Associate Director, Major Gifts will support the recruitment and management of ClientEarth's U.S. Board of Trustees, a group of volunteer leaders who will serve as key drivers of the expansion of ClientEarth's philanthropic footprint stateside.

Support the Director of Development in the development and review of systems and procedures and as appropriate, advise on the necessary adaptation of such for the U.S. fundraising program. Develop the U.S. major donor pipeline; create and implement cultivation, solicitation and stewardship strategies. Build and manage a personal portfolio of major donor prospects capable of making gifts of $10,000 or more. Personally solicit major contributions individually and as part of a solicitation team. Devise and manage cultivation and stewardship events for prospective and existing donors. Support the recruitment and management of the U.S. Board of Trustees and serve as the main fundraising contact in the U.S. for the Board of Trustees and Development Board. Maintain accurate, up to date data and records and produce progress and financial reports for senior management in the UK as well as the various Boards. Develop public-facing major donor communications materials consistent with brand guidelines, in coordination with the UK-based communications team and program staff as appropriate.

Advanced J Job Postdoctoral Associate Job Job posted by: Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Posted on: April 8, 2016 Share Bookmark Print More / Less Job description WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY POSITION DESCRIPTION Term position subject to funding availability June 1, 2016 to May 31, 2018 with possibility of 2-year extension DEPARTMENT : Wildlife Health & Health Policy Program JOB TITLE :  Postdoctoral Associate POSITION LOCATION: Bozeman, Montana REPORTS TO :  Associate Director, Wildlife Epidemiology HOURS :  Full time JOB DESCRIPTION : The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is seeking a Postdoctoral Associate to help lead a Department of Defense-funded project, entitled ""Assessing white-nose syndrome in the context of non-stationary conditions in an advancing continental epidemic."" Research outcomes from this study will be used to evaluate the transferability of a bioenergetics-based mechanistic model of white-nose syndrome (WNS) survivorship (Hayman et al. 2016) to western North American bat species. This is a WCS position under the supervision of Dr. Sarah H. Olson (Associate Director, Wildlife Epidemiology, WCS Wildlife Health & Health Policy). In addition the Postdoctoral Associate will closely liaise with Dr. Raina K. Plowright (Assistant Professor, Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Montana State University). The associate will also interact with co-PIs Dr. Liam P. McGuire (Assistant Professor, Department of Biological Sciences at Texas Tech University), Dr. David Hayman (Co-Director of an OIE Collaborating Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Public Health, the Molecular Epidemiology and Public Health Laboratory ( m EpiLab), Massey University, New Zealand), Dr. Brett G. Dickson (Chief Scientist and President of Conservation Science Partners), as well as with Project Advisor, Dr. Cori L. Lausen (Research Scientist, Wildlife Conservation Society Canada). The project abstract will be posted at: https://www.serdp-estcp.org/Program-Areas/Resource-Conservation-and-Climate-Change/Natural-Resources/Species-Ecology-and-Management/RC-2633 . The proposed work will be at the interface of modeling and fieldwork. We require someone with excellent quantitative skills with some experience with free-ranging wildlife and the potential to develop excellent field skills. Two Postdoctoral Associates, one based in Bozeman, Montana, with an emphasis on disease ecology and modeling skills (this job description), and another based in Lubbock, Texas, with an emphasis on physiology skills (Texas Tech University; please see separate call) will be hired. Together, the Postdoctoral Associates will jointly help design study implementation, secure state/federal permits, coordinate and execute field logistics, collect research data, develop mechanistic survivorship and ecological niche models, and examine the risks of WNS to western bats using a bioenergetics approach. A major emphasis of the project is to develop these models in the context of future conditions, including those related to climate change. The Postdoctoral Associates will collect bioenergetics and environmental data during field missions, consisting of fall and winter sampling at sites throughout the West. We expect the Postdoctoral Associate to be in the field as part of a 3-person team (the two Postdoctoral Associates and a field technician) or traveling for project related meetings at least 12 weeks each year. During field missions the team will be tasked with collecting bioenergetics data, including morphometrics, body composition, and measurement of metabolic rates with respirometry. Environmental data will be collected simultaneously to understand the variation in microclimate conditions experienced by hibernating bats. The Postdoctoral Associate(s) will jointly use new and existing data to parameterize and adapt a mechanistic WNS survivorship model that predicts the capacity of bats to survive hibernation given the bioenergetic disruptions caused by the fungal infection. The data collected will be used to build integrated ecological niche and mechanistic WNS models using plausible future projected climate and land-cover change scenarios. The Postdoctoral Associate will be based in Bozeman, Montana, but should expect to spend at least 12 weeks per year conducting fieldwork throughout the western U.S. or traveling for project-related meetings. Continuation of this position is subject to funding availability, with the potential for a 2-year extension for a total of 4 years. REQUIREMENTS AND QUALIFICATIONS: A postgraduate qualification (PhD) in disease ecology, ecology, bioenergetics, physiology, ecological modeling, biology, or related field. Excellent interpersonal skills, team skills, and communication skills (oral and written); an ability to adapt to field challenges, while maintaining a high professional standard. Experience conducting independent scientific research, including having a solid understanding of data collection and management. Experience handling bats, caving, and working on WNS research not required but strongly desired (one of the two Postdoctoral Associates must have bat handling experience). Experience with biostatistics, epidemiology, and/or mathematical and simulation modeling (preferred). Competence in fieldwork and comfort working in a team environment. Valid driver's license and willingness to drive a pick-up truck long-distances towing a trailer. Experience working with government partners preferred but not essential. Experience driving a snow-mobile and 4-wheeled all-terrain vehicle is preferred but not essential. Willingness to work flexible hours that may include weekends and public holidays; ability to work safely and effectively throughout the night, in caves or mines, in remote locations, and in cold winter conditions. PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITIES : In consultation and coordination with the Principal Investigator and project co-PIs: Design study implementation, secure state/federal permits, coordinate and execute field logistics, and collect research data in coordination with project team members and partners. Ensure the safety of all personnel involved in the project, including the development and use of occupational health and safety guidelines tailored to project needs, and provide oversight of all relevant aspects of biosafety and animal handling, if/as applicable.
